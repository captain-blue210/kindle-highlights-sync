# Project Brief: Obsidian Kindle Highlights Sync

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to enable users to easily synchronize their Kindle highlights and notes directly into their Obsidian vault.

## 2. Problem Statement

Kindle users often highlight passages and make notes while reading. Accessing and integrating these annotations into personal knowledge management systems like Obsidian can be cumbersome, often requiring manual export/import processes or relying on less direct methods. This plugin aims to streamline this workflow.

## 3. Core Requirements

*   Fetch highlights and notes from a user's Kindle account.
*   Format and import these annotations into Obsidian notes.
*   Provide a user-friendly interface within Obsidian for managing the synchronization process.
*   Support different Amazon regional domains (e.g., .com, .co.jp, .co.uk).
*   Allow users to customize the format and organization of imported notes.

## 4. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Authentication with Amazon Kindle Cloud Reader.
    *   Fetching book metadata, highlights, and notes.
    *   Creating/updating Obsidian notes based on fetched data.
    *   Configuration options for sync behavior and note formatting.
    *   Handling different Amazon regions.
*   **Out of Scope (Initially):**
    *   Syncing annotations *from* Obsidian *to* Kindle.
    *   Advanced conflict resolution beyond simple overwrites or updates.
    *   Support for non-Amazon e-reader platforms.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   Users can successfully authenticate and sync their Kindle highlights.
*   The synchronization process is reliable and efficient.
*   User feedback indicates a significant improvement in their workflow for integrating Kindle notes into Obsidian.
