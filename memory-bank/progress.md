# Progress: Obsidian Kindle Highlights Sync (2025-03-29)

## 1. What Works

*   **Basic Plugin Structure:** The fundamental Obsidian plugin structure (`main.ts`, `manifest.json`, settings tab via `settings.ts`) is in place.
*   **Build Process:** The project can be built using TypeScript and esbuild.
*   **Core Service Stubs:** Service files for API interaction (`kindle-api.ts`), parsing (`highlight-parser.ts`), rendering (`template-renderer.ts`), and metadata (`metadata-service.ts`) exist, outlining the intended separation of concerns.
*   **Data Models:** Basic data models for `Book` and `Highlight` (`models/`) are defined.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been established.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Focus: Login Feature)

*   **Amazon Login Modal (`AmazonLoginModal.ts`):**
    *   Implement `iframe` embedding of the Amazon login page.
    *   Implement dynamic loading of region-specific login URLs.
    *   Implement robust detection of successful login via URL redirection monitoring.
    *   Implement communication of login status (success/failure) back to the main plugin/service.
*   **Session Management (`KindleApiService` / `AmazonLoginModal`):**
    *   Determine and implement the mechanism for leveraging the established session (cookies) for subsequent actions.
    *   Implement secure handling/storage if necessary (though reliance on implicit session is the current plan).
*   **Amazon Logout Modal & Logic (New):**
    *   Create the `AmazonLogoutModal`.
    *   Implement the logic to effectively clear the Amazon session/cookies within the Obsidian environment.
*   **Integration (`KindleApiService`, `main.ts`):**
    *   Integrate the login status check into the sync workflow.
    *   Ensure `KindleApiService` uses the established session for data fetching.
*   **Data Fetching (`KindleApiService`):**
    *   Implement the actual logic to fetch books and highlights from Kindle Cloud Reader using the authenticated session (likely involving scraping or interacting with the Cloud Reader's internal APIs if accessible).
*   **Parsing & Rendering Logic:**
    *   Flesh out the implementation details in `HighlightParser` and `TemplateRenderer` to process the fetched data and create Obsidian notes.
*   **Settings Refinement:** Add UI elements for Amazon region selection and potentially other login-related settings.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for login, logout, and data fetching processes.
*   **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing across different scenarios and Amazon regions.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Planning & Setup:** The project is in the initial implementation phase for the core Cloud Reader authentication feature. Foundational documentation and project structure are set up.
*   **Blocked:** The primary functionality (syncing highlights) is blocked until the authentication mechanism is successfully implemented.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Authentication Implementation:** The core task of implementing the `iframe`-based login, session handling, and logout is the main blocker. Technical challenges related to cross-context scripting, cookie management, and the brittleness of relying on Amazon's web UI structure are anticipated.
*   **Session Persistence/Usage:** Uncertainty remains about the best way to reliably use the `iframe`-established session for background API calls/scraping within Obsidian's limitations.
*   **Logout Reliability:** Clearing cookies set within an `iframe` from the parent context can be technically challenging and requires investigation.
*   **Scraping Brittleness:** The data fetching process, likely relying on scraping the Cloud Reader HTML, will be prone to breaking if Amazon updates its website.
